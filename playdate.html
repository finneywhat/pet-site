    <h1>Play Dates for Days</h1>
    <p>Steve loves play dates - that can't be stressed enough. If your dog also loves play dates
    <em><strong>AND</strong></em> has a human name, then you are welcome to contact us to schedule
    a date. Keep in mind that Steve is a gangster dog and will likely maul your dog. If
    that's cool with you, bring it on.
    </p>
    <p>Refer to Steve's <a href="contact-page.html">Contact Page</a> for his schedule.
